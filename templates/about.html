	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p class="flow-text">I started programming in the fall of 2015, and shortly after enrolled in Galvanize, SoMa, to further my education. There, I learned how to build and break web applications using the SEAN stack.</p>
	<p class="flow-text">From there, I gravitated more towards building servers, and keeping information secure. </p>
