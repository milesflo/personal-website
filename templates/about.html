	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p class="flow-text"> Hello! My name is Miles Florence. I started programming in fall of 2015, and I'd like to think I've learned something new every day since! I really like figuring out how things work... Whether it's disecting someone else's code, or taking apart a toaster, I am a natural tinkerer.</p>
